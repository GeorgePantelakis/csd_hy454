## NOTE
Turnin didn't allow us to send binary files, like pictures and audio files. 
As a result the compiled project will not have all the features the original was supposed to have.

## About Implementation
The implementation of the work was done in the environment of Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.  
For the graphics the Allegro5 library was used, which we used through the NuGet Package Manager  
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and the activation of the necessary Addons from the properties of  
the project (Image, Truetype Font, Primitives, Audio, Audio Codec Addons). To run the game, a  
new project must be created, with the above features, and the code imported. Note that in the  
config.ini file the necessary changes must be made to the path of the variables depending on  
the structure of the project.
